# mini-shazam
Our project draws inspiration from the famous app Shazam and aims to recreate its core functionality using the GTZAN dataset and various machine learning algorithms. Through our project, we seek to explore the fundamental aspects of audio signal processing, feature extraction, and classification techniques to study, classify, and even recommend music based on audio inputs. Our goal is to develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload audio files and get accurate and fast results for identifying songs and discovering new music.
