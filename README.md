# mini-shazam
Our project is inspired by the famous app Shazam and aims to recreate its core functionality using the GTZAN dataset and various ML algorithms. Through this, we seek to explore the fundamental aspects of audio signal processing, feature extraction, and classification techniques to study, classify, and even recommend music based on audio inputs.
